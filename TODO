Implement boolean logic
  have two values on stack, hit operator, will either execute next command, or the one after that
  only available in command creation mode
Implement goto
  searches backwards through the current command for the label that we want to go to
  some special labels, start/end to go to start or end of command
Implement variables
  possibility to store numbers and labels as named entities
Implement label counters?
  position in command, stack length, etc. should be made visible
  maybe also keep a counter for each label in the command to see how often it has
  been encountered? Could work as loop iteration counters
Implement graphic drawing capabalities?
  Not sure how this would work, but would be cool
Implement string features
  Add, concat, slice, index, etc.

Fix bug where tmp commands are deleted on exit when part of a custom command
